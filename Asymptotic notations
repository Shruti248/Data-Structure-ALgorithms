Asymptotic Noations : Camparision of 2 algo

3 types :-
    1)Big O 
    2)Big Omega
    3)Big Theta

-->Big O 
    A function f(n) is said to be O(Gn) iff there exists Constant c & a Constant n0 such that 
            0 <=f(n) <= c g(n)      for n>=n0

    When camparing 2 algo :-
        f(n) = time 
        n = input size
        g(n) = function that comes inside O
