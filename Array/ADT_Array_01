ABSTRACT DATA TYPE & ARRAY 

-->ADT : Minimal requirements & some operations 
-ADT IS THE MODEL TO CREATE DATA STRUCTURES.(By seeing this one can implement the data structure.)

NOTE : ADT IS MRF(Minimal requirement Functionility)

ARRAYs as and Abstrat Data type.
 -->Minimum Functionilities of arrays
  -get(i) : will get the element of i th position
  -set(i) : setting any number at position i 
 -->Methods (operations that can be performed on arrays)
    -insert
    -delete
    -add
    -resize  

Abstraction is hiding the details.(that is implementation is hidden abt how it is done)

Array : Collection of elements accessible by an index.
 --> Thre is faster access of elements of the array than the othere data structures.
 -->Limitations:
    -insertion is difficult if there is not sufficient space(that is first we have to copy to another array & increase the size then we can insert)
    -In deletion , we need to move all the other elements which is after it & will take a lot of time.(also wastage of memory)

We will implement array & ADT using structure.
