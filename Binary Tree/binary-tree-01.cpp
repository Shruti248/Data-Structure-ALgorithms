// Max 2 children : Binary Tree

// Properties 
// Maximum nodes at level L : 2^L (l = 0 --> 1 , l = 1 --> 2 , l = 2 --> 4)

// Maximum nodes in a tree at height h = 2^h-1 (h starts from 1)

// For N Nodes , minimum possible hieght or minimum number of levels are log(N+1)(Base 2);

// A binary tree with L Leaves has at least log(n+1)(Base 2) + 1 number of levels
