// How to implement a stack which will support the following operations in O(1) time complexity? 
// 1) push() which adds an element to the top of stack. 
// 2) pop() which removes an element from top of stack. 
// 3) findMiddle() which will return middle element of the stack. 
// 4) deleteMiddle() which will delete the middle element.
